# My Game Design Literature Review

## About Me

I am a PhD researcher trained in analyzing complex dynamic systems.
I am particularly interested in how combat, stealth, and player decision-making interact in open-world games.

My background is in scientific research, but my long-term focus is game design — especially systems that balance player freedom, readability, and challenge.

## Design Focus

- Open-world combat systems
- Stealth–combat transitions
- Enemy awareness and player feedback
- Risk–reward loops
- Player learning curves

## Combat & Stealth Analysis

In open-world games, stealth and combat often coexist rather than replace each other.
A key design challenge is ensuring that failure in stealth transitions naturally into combat,
instead of feeling like a punishment.

I am particularly interested in:
- How enemy awareness states are communicated to the player
- How partial detection creates tension rather than frustration
- How combat systems reward adaptation instead of memorization

## From Research to Game Design

My academic background involves studying systems with multiple states,
uncertainty, and rapid transitions.

This experience translates naturally to game design problems such as:
- Enemy state machines
- Combat phase transitions
- Balancing systems under noisy player behavior

🎮 Genshin Impact
Design Focus

Large-scale open-world combat designed for a character-collection (gacha) game.

Core Mechanics

Genshin Impact centers its combat system around four-character team switching and elemental reactions.
Players are encouraged to rotate characters frequently, triggering elemental interactions that define both damage output and crowd control.

Design Strengths

The rapid character-switching mechanic allows for expressive combat without overwhelming mechanical complexity.
Elemental reactions provide a clear risk–reward structure: optimal performance requires planning team composition rather than execution-heavy inputs.

This design is particularly effective for a live-service gacha game, where frequent character updates must integrate smoothly into an existing system.

Design Insights

Genshin Impact demonstrates how combat depth can emerge from system interactions rather than mechanical difficulty.
By shifting complexity toward team composition and timing, the game remains accessible while still rewarding system mastery.
This approach scales well for long-term content updates and diverse player skill levels.

🦇 Batman: Arkham Series
Design Focus

Stealth-driven level design with flexible transitions between stealth and combat.

Core Mechanics

The Arkham series emphasizes predator-style stealth gameplay, supported by highly vertical level design.
Environments include vantage points, ground-level cover, tunnels, and multi-layered spaces, each paired with distinct stealth actions and takedowns.

When detected, players are given tools—such as slow-motion aiming and smoke grenades—that allow recovery rather than immediate failure.

Design Strengths

The level design supports stealth at multiple spatial layers, encouraging players to read and manipulate enemy positioning.
Importantly, stealth failure does not immediately force combat; instead, the game offers transitional mechanics that preserve player agency.

Enemy AI dynamically adapts to player tactics, gradually countering frequently used gadgets or approaches, which prevents repetitive optimal strategies.

Design Insights

The Arkham series shows that forgiving stealth systems can encourage experimentation.
By allowing recovery after mistakes and enabling smooth stealth–combat transitions, the game reduces frustration while maintaining tension.
Adaptive enemy behavior further reinforces long-term engagement and tactical variety.

🎖️ Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain
Design Focus

Deep integration of stealth and combat within a systemic sandbox.

Core Mechanics

MGSV provides extensive mission preparation options, including buddy selection, loadout customization, and insertion methods.
The game offers a wide variety of tools—ranging from lethal weapons to humorous distraction items—that support diverse playstyles.

Enemy AI responds dynamically to player behavior over time, adapting equipment and tactics based on observed patterns.

Design Strengths

The enemy response system creates a sense of a learning world: repeated player behaviors lead to meaningful changes in enemy loadouts and defenses.
Classic CQC mechanics offer close-range control options that naturally bridge stealth and combat encounters.

Because shooting mechanics are robust, transitions from stealth to open combat feel seamless rather than punitive.

Design Insights

MGSV demonstrates how systemic AI adaptation can reinforce player identity.
By reacting to player habits, the game transforms individual choices into long-term consequences.
This approach deepens immersion while maintaining flexibility between stealth and combat playstyles.
