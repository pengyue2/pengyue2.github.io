# My Game Design Literature Review

## About Me

I am a PhD researcher trained in analyzing complex dynamic systems.
I am particularly interested in how combat, stealth, and player decision-making interact in open-world games.

My background is in scientific research, but my long-term focus is game design — especially systems that balance player freedom, readability, and challenge.

## Design Focus

- Open-world combat systems
- Stealth–combat transitions
- Enemy awareness and player feedback
- Risk–reward loops
- Player learning curves

## Combat & Stealth Analysis

In open-world games, stealth and combat often coexist rather than replace each other.
A key design challenge is ensuring that failure in stealth transitions naturally into combat,
instead of feeling like a punishment.

I am particularly interested in:
- How enemy awareness states are communicated to the player
- How partial detection creates tension rather than frustration
- How combat systems reward adaptation instead of memorization

## From Research to Game Design

My academic background involves studying systems with multiple states,
uncertainty, and rapid transitions.

This experience translates naturally to game design problems such as:
- Enemy state machines
- Combat phase transitions
- Balancing systems under noisy player behavior
