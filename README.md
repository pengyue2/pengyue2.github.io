# Open-World Combat & Stealth Design Notes

## About Me

I am a PhD researcher trained in analyzing complex dynamic systems,
with a long-term focus on combat and stealth design in open-world games.

My primary interest lies in how player decision-making,
enemy awareness, and systemic feedback interact moment to moment —
especially in situations where stealth degrades into combat
and players must adapt rather than restart.

Although my academic background is in scientific research,
my design focus is firmly on building and analyzing
readable, forgiving, and expressive gameplay systems.

## Design Focus

My analysis centers on the following design areas:

- Open-world combat systems
- Stealth–combat transitions
- Enemy awareness and detection states
- Player feedback and readability
- Risk–reward loops and player learning curves

## Combat & Stealth Design Philosophy

In many open-world games, stealth and combat are not separate modes
but part of a continuous spectrum.

A key design challenge is ensuring that stealth failure
does not feel like punishment,
but instead creates meaningful tactical shifts.

I am particularly interested in:
- How enemy awareness states are communicated clearly
- How partial detection sustains tension rather than frustration
- How systems reward adaptation instead of rote optimization

## From Research to Game Design

My academic work involves studying systems with multiple states,
uncertainty, and non-linear transitions.

This perspective translates naturally to game design problems such as:
- Enemy state machines and detection logic
- Stealth–combat phase transitions
- Balancing systems under noisy and unpredictable player behavior

I approach game analysis with an emphasis on
systemic robustness rather than ideal play.

  Forgiving stealth systems and player recovery after mistakes.

- **[Metal Gear Solid V – Stealth–Combat Integration](mgsv.md)**  
  Systemic enemy adaptation and long-term player consequence.

- **[Genshin Impact – Open-World Combat Systems](genshin.md)**  
  Team-based combat, character switching, and live-service constraints.

- **[Varsapura – Speculative Combat Design Notes](varsapura.md)**  
  A forward-looking analysis based on publicly released gameplay,
  exploring combat, stealth, and system integration in an urban open world.
