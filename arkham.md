## 🦇 Batman: Arkham Series
Design Focus

Stealth-driven level design with flexible transitions between stealth and combat.

Core Mechanics

The Arkham series emphasizes predator-style stealth gameplay, supported by highly vertical level design.
Environments include vantage points, ground-level cover, tunnels, and multi-layered spaces, each paired with distinct stealth actions and takedowns.

When detected, players are given tools—such as slow-motion aiming and smoke grenades—that allow recovery rather than immediate failure.

Design Strengths

The level design supports stealth at multiple spatial layers, encouraging players to read and manipulate enemy positioning.
Importantly, stealth failure does not immediately force combat; instead, the game offers transitional mechanics that preserve player agency.

Enemy AI dynamically adapts to player tactics, gradually countering frequently used gadgets or approaches, which prevents repetitive optimal strategies.

Design Insights

The Arkham series shows that forgiving stealth systems can encourage experimentation.
By allowing recovery after mistakes and enabling smooth stealth–combat transitions, the game reduces frustration while maintaining tension.
Adaptive enemy behavior further reinforces long-term engagement and tactical variety.
